# WINkLink Random Number Service

## Overview
Verifiable Random Function (VRF) is the public-key version of a keyed cryptographic hash, which can be used as a random number. Only the holder of the private key can compute the hash, but anyone with the public key can verify the correctness of the hash.
VRF can be used to generate secure and reliable random numbers.

Random number is determined by seed (provided by users), nonce (private state of VRFCoordinator contract) , block hash (the block of the request event) and private key of oracle node.

The generation process of VRF is:
- A Dapp contract sends out an on-chain request for a random number;
- Once the off-chain oracle node listens for the request, it generates a random number attaching the cryptographic proof to make the generated random number verifiable, and then submits them back to an oracle contract (VRFCoordinator);
- Once the random number proof is verified by the oracle contract, the random number is published to the Dapp contract through a callback function.

The process above ensures that the random number cannot be tampered with nor manipulated by anyone, including oracle operators, miners, users and even smart contract developers.

WINkLink VRF is a provably-fair and verifiable source of randomness designed for Dapp contracts. Dapp contract developers can use WINkLink VRF as a tamper-proof RNG (Random Number Generator) to build reliable smart contracts for any applications which rely on unpredictable random number:
- Blockchain games and NFTs
- Random assignment of duties and resources (e.g. randomly assigning judges to cases)
- Choosing a representative sample for consensus mechanisms

The WINkLink VRF solution contains both off-chain and on-chain components:

- VRF Coordinator (on-chain component): Crafted to interact with the VRF service. It emits an event when a request for randomness is initiated, and then validates the resultant random number and proof of how it was generated by the VRF service.
- VRF Wrapper (on-chain component): A wrapper for the VRF Coordinator that offers an interface for consuming contracts.
- VRF service (off-chain node): Listens for requests by subscribing to the VRF Coordinator event logs and calculates a random number based on the block hash and nonce. The VRF service then sends a transaction to the VRFCoordinator including the random number and a proof of how it was generated.

This article describes how to deploy and use the WINkLink VRF service.

## VRF Request Process
1. The Dapp contract invokes the `calculateRequestPrice` function of `VRFV2Wrapper` to estimate the total transaction cost required for random number generation.

2. The Dapp contract calls the `transferAndCall` function of `WinkMid` to pay the calculated request price to the Wrapper. This method sends Wink tokens and executes the `onTokenTransfer` logic of `VRFV2Wrapper`.

3. The `onTokenTransfer` logic of `VRFV2Wrapper` triggers the `requestRandomWords` function of `VRFCoordinatorV2` to request a random number.

4. The `VRFCoordinatorV2` contract emits the `RandomWordsRequested` event.

5. The VRF node captures this event and awaits the specified number of block confirmations. It then returns the random values and proof through the `fulfillRandomWords` function to the `VRFCoordinatorV2` contract.

6. The `VRFCoordinatorV2` contract verifies the proof on the blockchain and subsequently calls back the `fulfillRandomWords` function of `VRFV2Wrapper`.

7. Lastly, the `VRFV2Wrapper` calls back the Dapp contract to complete the request.

## Before you start

Maintainers for WINkLink need to understand how the TRON platform works, and know about smart contract deployment and the process of calling them. You're suggested to read related [TRON official documents](https://cn.developers.tron.network/), particularly those on contract deployment on TronIDE.

Prepare the node account. You should read related [Node account preparation doc](https://doc.winklink.org/v1/doc/en/deploy.html#prepare-node-account).

## VRFCoordinatorV2 Contract
VRFCoordinatorV2 contract is deployed on the TRON public chain with the following features:

- Receive random number requests from Dapp contract and emit VRFRequest event
    - WIN transfer as fees, will be sent along with the request
- Accept random number and the proof submitted from WINkLink node
    - VRFCoordinator contract will verify the proof before sending the random number to Dapp contract
- Calculate the WINkLink node rewards for the request fulfilment


<!--VRFCoordinator contract code is available at [VRFCoordinator.sol](https://github.com/wink-link/winklink/tree/master/tvm-contracts/v1.0/VRF/VRFCoordinator.sol) .-->


Some parameters are needed in the constructor function when deploying a VRFCoordinator contract:
```js
  constructor(
    address wink,
    address blockhashStore,
    address winkMid
  )
```
`_blockHashStore` BlockHashStore address, `_win` WIN token address, `_winkMid` WinkMid contract address.

**Configuration parameters**\
`keyHash` : Node keyhash\
`maxNumWords` : maximum number of random words per vrf request，currently set as 10

<!--
## Node Deployment
For node deployment, please refer to [WINkLink Node Deploy Doc](https://doc.winklink.org/v1/doc/en/deploy.html) .  This section only lists the differences of VRF node deployment.

WINkLink node should be deployed after the VRFCoordinator contract is deployed.

WINkLink node (project directory `node`) code is available at: <https://github.com/wink-link/winklink/tree/master/node>.

After compilation, `node-v1.0.jar` will be stored in `node/build/libs/` under the project root directory.

### Node Configuration

After the node configuration file is confirmed, it is required to create a `vrfKeyStore.yml` file and set the private key for VRF (support multiple VRF private keys in one node):

```text
privateKeys:
  - *****(private key in hexadecimal format)
```

Support for dynamically updating vrfkeystore without restarting the node server. The steps are:

First, add a new VRF private key to the `vrfKeyStore.yml` 

Second, execute the following command:

```sh
curl --location --request GET 'http://localhost:8081/vrf/updateVRFKey/vrfKeyStore.yml'
```

::: tip
It is for important safety concerns that you use files to provide private information instead of the command line. In the production environment, set the permission of the private file `vrfKeyStore` as 600, meaning that only the owner can read or write the data.
:::

### Start a Node

All configuration files need to be copied to the directory where your node is running in, use the command `cp node/src/main/resource/*.yml ./`.
At the same time, the `tronApiKey` part of the `application dev` file needs to be filled with apikey.

Start your WINkLink node using the following command:

```sh
java -jar node/build/libs/node-v1.0.jar -k key.store -vrfK vrfKeyStore.yml
```

Configuration items can also be specified using a command line. For example:

mainnet:
```sh
java -jar node/build/libs/node-v1.0.jar --server.port=8081 --spring.profiles.active=dev --key key.store  --vrfKey vrfKeyStore.yml
```
nile testnet:
```sh
java -jar node/build/libs/node-v1.0.jar --env dev --server.port=8081 --spring.profiles.active=dev --key key.store  --vrfKey vrfKeyStore.yml
```

Determine whether your WINkLink node is running properly using the following command:

```sh
tail -f logs/tron.log
```

::: warning
Your node account must have enough TRX tokens for contract calls.
You can apply testnet tokens at Testnet Faucet.
:::

### Add a Job to Your Node

The job of your node represents the data service that your node supports, and each job has a unique 32-byte ID. 

When your WINkLink node is running properly, you can add a job to your node via HTTP API:

Example: (change the parameter below:  `address`  is the VRFCoordinator contract address deployed in the steps above; 
`publicKey` is the compressed value of the node's public key, which can be obtained by viewing the terminal display after the node starts, and the corresponding item is `eckey compressed`)

```sh
curl --location --request POST 'http://localhost:8081/job/specs' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data-raw '{
    "initiators": [
        {
        "type": "randomnesslog",
        "params": {
            "address": "TYmwSFuFuiDZCtYsRFKCNr25byeqHH7Esb"
        }
        }
    ],
    "tasks": [
        {
        "type": "random",
        "params": {
        "publicKey":"0x024e6bda4373bea59ec613b8721bcbb56222ab2ec10b18ba24ae369b7b74ab1452"
        }
        },
        {
        "type": "trontx",
        "params": {
            "type": "TronVRF"
        }
	}
    ]
    }'
```

### Query Jobs

Request example:

```sh
curl --location --request GET 'http://localhost:8081/job/specs'
```
-->

## Authorize a Node Account

Node account needs authorization to submit data to VRFCoordinatorV2 contract, otherwise error will be reported.

The owner of the VRFCoordinatorV2 contract is required to call the contract below and add the node account to the whitelist:

```js
  function registerProvingKey(address oracle, uint256[2] calldata publicProvingKey) external onlyOwner
```

`_oracle` is the address of the registered node, which is used to receive the WIN token paid by DAPP ,
`_publicProvingKey` is the public key used by the registration node to generate random numbers, 

Call example: `registerProvingKey(TYmwSFuFuiDZCtYsRFKCNr25byeqHH7Esb,['6273228386041830135141271310112248407537170435188969735053134748570771583756',67273502359025519559461602732298865784327759914690240925031700564257821594585'])`

## Dapp Contract

Main steps to set up your consuming contract：
- a) Import and inherit VRFV2WrapperConsumerBase
```js
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
// An example of a consumer contract that directly pays for each request.
pragma solidity ^0.8.7;

import "./VRFV2WrapperConsumerBase.sol";

contract VRFv2DirectFundingConsumer is VRFV2WrapperConsumerBase{}
```

- b) Contract must implement the `fulfillRandomWords` function, which is the callback VRF function. Here, you add logic to handle the random values after they are returned to your contract.
```js
 function fulfillRandomWords(
        uint256 _requestId,
        uint256[] memory _randomWords
    )
```

- c) Contract invoke `requestRandomness` function to trigger a VRF request.
```js
 function requestRandomWords()
    external
    onlyOwner
    returns (uint256 requestId)
    {
        requestId = requestRandomness(
            msg.sender,
            callbackGasLimit,
            requestConfirmations,
            numWords
        );
        s_requests[requestId] = RequestStatus({
            paid: VRF_V2_WRAPPER.calculateRequestPrice(callbackGasLimit, numWords),
            randomWords: new uint256[](0),
            fulfilled: false
        });
        requestIds.push(requestId);
        lastRequestId = requestId;
        emit RequestSent(requestId, numWords);
        return requestId;
    }
```
